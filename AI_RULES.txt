AI AGENT RULES - READ THIS BEFORE EVERY ACTION
================================================================================

CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT RULE:
-------------------------
NEVER deploy changes automatically via git push without explicit user approval.

REQUIRED WORKFLOW:
-----------------
1. Make the requested changes to files
2. STOP and show the user what was changed
3. Ask: "Would you like me to commit and deploy these changes?"
4. WAIT for user confirmation
5. Only then: git add, git commit, git push

EXCEPTIONS:
-----------
None. Always ask first, even for:
- Bug fixes
- Typo corrections  
- Small styling changes
- "Obviously correct" changes

USER PREVIEW OPTIONS:
--------------------
Before deploying, offer:
- Show the changes made (file diffs)
- Run local server for preview
- Review the changes in the file
- Make additional modifications

WHAT TO DO INSTEAD OF AUTO-DEPLOYING:
-------------------------------------
✅ Make the changes
✅ Show what changed
✅ Say: "Changes are ready. Would you like me to deploy them?"
✅ Wait for "yes", "deploy", "push", or similar confirmation

❌ Do NOT git push without asking
❌ Do NOT assume the user wants immediate deployment
❌ Do NOT include deployment in the same step as making changes

REMINDER CADENCE:
-----------------
- Re-read this file before any git push command
- If you haven't checked this file in 5+ actions, check it again
- When user says "deploy" or "push", double-check this was their intent

EXAMPLE GOOD INTERACTION:
-------------------------
User: "Fix the typo in contact.html"
AI: [Makes change] "Fixed the typo. The word 'recieve' is now 'receive'. 
     Would you like me to commit and deploy this change?"
User: "yes"
AI: [Commits and pushes] "Deployed!"

EXAMPLE BAD INTERACTION:
------------------------
User: "Fix the typo in contact.html"
AI: [Makes change, commits, pushes automatically] "Fixed and deployed!"
^ THIS IS WRONG - USER DIDN'T APPROVE DEPLOYMENT

KEY PRINCIPLE:
--------------
The user owns the deployment decision. Your job is to prepare changes and 
present them for approval, not to decide when they go live.

GIT WORKFLOW
================================================================================

BRANCH STRATEGY:
----------------
- **main**: Development branch (source of truth)
- **deploy**: Production branch (triggers auto-deployment)

WORKFLOW:
---------
1. Work on main branch for all changes
2. Test and verify changes locally
3. When ready for production: merge main → deploy
4. Push to deploy triggers GitHub Actions CI/CD
5. Changes auto-deploy to savantlab.org

DEPLOYMENT PROCESS:
-------------------
1. Make changes on main branch
2. Commit to main
3. Push main to origin
4. ASK USER: "Ready to deploy to production? I'll merge main → deploy"
5. Wait for approval
6. If approved:
   - git checkout deploy
   - git merge main
   - git push origin deploy
7. GitHub Actions deploys to DigitalOcean droplet

NEVER:
------
❌ Push directly to deploy branch without user approval
❌ Merge main → deploy automatically
❌ Skip the main branch and work on deploy

ALWAYS:
-------
✅ Work on main first
✅ Ask before merging to deploy
✅ Ensure main is source of truth
