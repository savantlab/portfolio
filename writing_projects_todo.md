**Next Steps**:
- [ ] Complete Chapter 2: Shared Framework analysis
- [ ] Complete Chapter 3: Divergence patterns
- [ ] Complete Chapter 4: Implications
- [ ] Generate all network visualizations
- [ ] Peer review submission
- [ ] Publisher outreach

**Repository**: `/Users/savantlab/Savantlab/2083`

### 2. Psychiatric Misconduct Case Study
**Status**: Idea/Planning  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Description**: Document institutional failures in diagnosing savant syndrome

**Key incidents to document**:
- [ ] First doctor: Attempted gender transition instead of cognitive assessment
  - Ignored presented artwork
  - Misdiagnosed cognitive atypicality as gender identity disorder
  - Response: Walked away, researched gender identity disorder pathology
  
- [ ] Second doctor (MIT-published): Denied cognitive basis of artwork
  - Quote: "Nothing in your brain doing your drawings"
  - Audio recorded (legal in Virginia/Canada single-party consent)
  - Disclosed recording after session
  - Ignored repeated presentation of artwork evidence

**Potential formats**:
- [ ] Standalone paper: "Psychiatric Gatekeeping in Savant Syndrome Diagnosis"
- [ ] Chapter in larger work on institutional failures
- [ ] Blog post series
- [ ] Portfolio case study

**Research needed**:
- [ ] Document diagnostic criteria for savant syndrome
- [ ] Research psychiatric training gaps in recognizing cognitive atypicality
- [ ] Analyze gender dysphoria misdiagnosis patterns
- [ ] Review literature on psychiatric dismissal of patient evidence

### 3. Mental Rotation Paper: "The Surreal Art of Mental Rotation"
**Status**: Active research  
**Priority**: High  
**Target Journal**: Cognitive Constraint (or peer-reviewed alternative)

**Sections**:
- [ ] Abstract (drafted in resume)
- [ ] Introduction: Allocentric model overview
- [ ] Literature Analysis: ML pipeline findings
- [ ] Methodology: Constraint testing framework
- [ ] Results: Empirical validation (eye tracking + event logs)
- [ ] Discussion: Paradigm implications
- [ ] Conclusion: Recommendations for field

**Supporting materials**:
- [ ] 280+ papers analysis complete
- [ ] Harmony tracking lab data collection ongoing
- [ ] Network visualizations of research trends

**Repository**: `/Users/savantlab/mental-rotation-research`

### 4. P=NP Cognitive Complexity Theory Paper
**Status**: Theory development  
**Priority**: High  
**Description**: Invalidating human-computer analogy via savant automatism

**Key arguments**:
- [ ] Allocentric model fails to constrain mental rotation
- [ ] Automatism art demonstrates efficient search of unconstrained space
- [ ] Invalidates Iris Van Rooij's cognitive complexity framework
- [ ] Extends to other savant "spaces" (music, memory, calculus, calendar counting)
- [ ] Mental rotation paradox resolution

**Sections needed**:
- [ ] Introduction: Human-computer analogy in cognitive science
- [ ] Background: Van Rooij's complexity theory
- [ ] The constraint problem: Allocentric model analysis
- [ ] Empirical evidence: Automatism art data
- [ ] Theoretical implications: P=NP for cognitive computation
- [ ] Extended domains: Other savant abilities
- [ ] Conclusion: New computational models of cognition

## Notes

**Recording laws for future reference**:
- Virginia: Single-party consent (legal to record conversations you're part of)
- Canada: Single-party consent (same)
- Always verify current laws before recording

**Writing style principles** (from resume work):
- Direct, no hedging
- Build accusations methodically with evidence
- Use concrete examples
- Drop academic distance when appropriate
- Strong moral judgments where warranted
- Narrative structure with metaphor
