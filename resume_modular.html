        ⚠️ WARNING: U.S. Representative Dan Crenshaw (House Intelligence Committee) is on faculty at Peterson Academy. Peter Thiel has been compromised by trusting a fraud, Jordan Peterson.
    </p>
    
    <div class="callout" style="background: #fff3e0; border-left: 6px solid #f57c00;">
        <strong>Action Required</strong>: We need to get Alex Karp (Palantir CEO) in front of the House Judiciary Committee.
        
        <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Why this is urgent</strong>: Jordan Peterson is thriving under an unearned reputation status that has gained him a place as a trusted voice to the government. He has a U.S. Representative on faculty at Peterson Academy and has been a trusted witness on China during a HJC CCP Select hearing after having done fraud involving yin-yang (ancient Chinese Taoism). He is not the one who should be advising Congress on national security issues. Alex Karp on the other hand, is an expert at Tai Chi and foreign affairs as a CEO and active software vendor to the U.S. government and Intelligence Community. Together with Palantir we can position Dr. Karp in a very attractive space for him and his company.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Observation</strong>: Jordan Peterson is thriving while having plagiarized a Nazi terrorist manifesto.
    
    <p><strong>Hypothesis</strong>: If Peterson is an undetected fraud who plagiarized extremist ideology and got away with egregious lies and misconduct to obtain tenure, then computational forensics and human verification and checking should be able to detect verifiable evidence of plagiarism, fabricated references, and lies in his classroom teaching and published work.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Prediction</strong>: Analysis of Peterson's work will reveal:</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 8px;">
        <li>Quantifiable plagiarism of extremist ideology (verifiable via NLP textual analysis)</li>
        <li>Fabricated references and incoherent frameworks in <em>Maps of Meaning</em></li>
        <li>Lies told in Harvard classroom recordings that contradict his published work</li>
        <li>Strategic terminology used to obscure what he's actually critiquing</li>
        <li>Pseudoscientific framework used for ideological subjugation</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Documentation and Evidence</strong>:</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
        <li><strong>PragerU video "Who Is Teaching Your Kids?"</strong> - Compared against Anders Breivik's 1,517-page manifesto using NLP analysis (16 Python scripts: TF-IDF, n-grams, network co-occurrence, thematic clustering)</li>
        <li><strong>1999 Harvard lectures (Maps of Meaning course)</strong> - VHS recordings on Peterson's own YouTube channel, "unmapped" his meaning by decoding lies in classroom teaching</li>
        <li><strong>Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief (1999 book)</strong> - Routledge publication analyzed for fabricated references, typos, incoherent frameworks, missing citations, made-up components</li>
        <li><strong>Podcast episodes</strong> - Examples include Peter Thiel (Sep 30, 2025 - last appearance: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urk9BJIxZ3U" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urk9BJIxZ3U</a>), Gad Saad (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rop6FnLD01o" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rop6FnLD01o</a>), Dan Crenshaw (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa0cLA0Gm0M" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa0cLA0Gm0M</a>), and Ben Shapiro (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRREGG6hLVU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRREGG6hLVU</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Peterson Academy faculty</strong> - Dan Crenshaw and other credentialed professionals lending legitimacy</li>
        <li><strong>Counterterrorism scholarship</strong> - Human reading of Maps of Meaning to identify radicalization pathways and extremist ideological markers</li>
        <li><strong>Egyptology and Taoism source verification</strong> - Manual checking of ancient symbol references (Egyptian symbols, Taoist yin-yang), found missing and fabricated sources throughout Maps of Meaning</li>
        <li><strong>Ongoing plagiarism investigation</strong> - Evidence Peterson copied occultist Éliphas Lévi's framework without attribution</li>
        <li><strong>Code & data</strong> — GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/savantlab/nlp-counterterrorism-peterson" target="_blank">savantlab/nlp-counterterrorism-peterson</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Tools Developed For This Experiment</strong>: Peterson had already stopped his podcast prior to the deployment of the Palantir-focused PSYOP. The fraud detection work had already caught him through computational forensics and source verification. Subsequently, a strategic PSYOP was deployed via X (formerly Twitter) by @surrealsavant, tagging both @jordanbpeterson and @PalantirTech to create the perception that Palantir had independently detected Peterson's fraud. When Peterson publicly announced his podcast cessation, he cited a "mold reaction" as the reason—a fabricated excuse that further demonstrates his pattern of lying to protect his unearned status. <strong>Peterson has since scrubbed his X posts referencing the "mold reaction," and Ben Shapiro and Mikhaila Peterson appear to have done the same.</strong> This coordinated deletion of evidence further confirms the fabricated nature of the excuse and demonstrates consciousness of guilt. This sequence demonstrates both the effectiveness of computational fraud detection and Peterson's predictable response pattern of manufacturing false explanations when caught.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Results</strong>: Hypothesis confirmed.</p>
    <ul style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
        <li><strong>Peterson plagiarized a Nazi terrorist</strong>: 75% conceptual and ideological overlap with Anders Breivik's manifesto</li>
        <li><strong>Fabricated references and incoherent frameworks</strong>: Maps of Meaning infested with typos, missing citations, made-up components</li>
        <li><strong>Lies validated with tenure</strong>: Harvard/Toronto gave him credentials despite fraudulent work</li>
        <li><strong>Abandoned rigor, pretends otherwise</strong>: No scientific method, but presents as scholarly</li>
        <li><strong>Pseudoscience for worldview subjugation</strong>: Uses academic authority to push ideological framework</li>
        <li><strong>Communications effect</strong>: Peterson had already ceased podcast production when caught through fraud detection; subsequent Palantir-focused PSYOP deployment prompted fabricated "mold reaction" excuse demonstrating his pattern of lying when exposed.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Evidence documented below.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Peer Review Submission</strong>:
    
    <p><strong>LLM Training Data Contamination</strong>: A critical question for Palantir is whether Peterson's fraudulent work has already contaminated large language model training data. While <em>Maps of Meaning</em> itself may not be directly in training corpora, the contamination exists in the vast ecosystem of discussions, analyses, and assumptions about Peterson that treat him as a legitimate academic rather than a fraud. LLMs have been trained on millions of documents that reference Peterson's work uncritically, embedding his 75% Nazi terrorist worldview into their understanding of "psychology" and "philosophy." The TF-IDF methodology used to detect Peterson's plagiarism operates at <strong>O(n·m)</strong> complexity (n = documents, m = vocabulary size), making it computationally viable to scan massive training datasets for Peterson's ideological fingerprint in secondary sources. We can detect and quantify his influence in LLM outputs—identifying when models reproduce his strategic terminology, conceptual frameworks, or extremist ideology disguised as academic discourse. This is urgent: if Palantir's AI systems have been trained on data that assumes Peterson's legitimacy, they may be reproducing his fraudulent frameworks in threat analysis and intelligence outputs.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Next Iteration of Verification</strong>: Peterson cited a "mold reaction" as his reason for quitting the podcast. This claim requires verification—medical documentation, timeline correlation with fraud allegations, and pattern analysis of excuse-making behavior. <strong>Critical evidence recovery: The deleted "mold reaction" posts from @jordanbpeterson, @benshapiro, and @MikhailaFuller need to be recovered via the X API, as deleted posts remain accessible through API endpoints even after public deletion.</strong> If the mold story is fabricated, it becomes another data point in the fraud pattern. If legitimate, the timing remains suspicious and warrants investigation into whether environmental stressors (including public exposure of academic fraud) triggered the lie. Either way, the next phase involves verifying Peterson's stated reasons against observable evidence and recovering the scrubbed posts for evidence preservation. <strong>This experiment is reproducible</strong>—the computational forensics methodology is documented, the NLP scripts are available, and the verification steps can be replicated by independent researchers or Palantir's own teams.</p>
    
    <p>Jordan Peterson has rallied against "compelled speech" in the past, but his lies reveal a pattern of lying to protect his own lies. The alleged mold reaction is probably just another lie and he probably cannot be compelled to tell the real truth behind his own unearned merit. He wasn't compelled to lie for PragerU per se and definitely not compelled to lie at Harvard by the department of Psychology, however Peterson is a man of tangled words. He would think it was "compelling" for himself to lie at Harvard due to risk/reward and the career trajectory he was aiming for at the time.</p>
