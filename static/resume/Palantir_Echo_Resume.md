## RESEARCH BREAKTHROUGH

**Resolved the Mental Rotation Paradox in Cognitive Science**  
Invalidated the allocentric model of spatial cognition—a theoretical framework that failed to constrain mental rotation despite decades of acceptance in the field. This breakthrough addresses a fundamental paradox in how humans process spatial information and challenges prevailing cognitive science orthodoxy.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Developed comprehensive ML pipeline for systematic literature analysis (280+ papers, 1970-present)
- Built automated research infrastructure using Python, scikit-learn, d6tflow, and NLP techniques
- Created citation prediction models (Random Forest), topic modeling (LDA), and clustering algorithms
- Designed asynchronous web scraping system with rate limiting and automatic checkpointing
- Engineered TF-IDF vectorization pipeline processing 1000+ features across academic corpus

## PROFESSIONAL PROJECTS

### Mental Rotation Research Platform | *Creator & Lead Developer* | 2024-Present
**Problem:** Cognitive science lacks comprehensive tooling for large-scale literature analysis in specialized domains  
**Solution:** Built end-to-end research automation platform

- **Research automation:** Async web scraper collecting 280+ articles with intelligent rate limiting and progress persistence
- **Machine learning pipeline:** 6-stage ML workflow for topic discovery, citation prediction, and paper clustering
- **LLM integration:** Auto-generated structured prompts for Claude/GPT-based meta-analysis at scale
- **Publication-ready package:** Installable Python library with CLI tools (`mental-rotation-scrape`, `mental-rotation-analyze`)
- **Impact:** Enables systematic analysis of 50+ years of mental rotation research, identifying patterns invisible to manual review

**Tech stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, d6tflow, asyncio, BeautifulSoup, GitHub Actions

### Parallel Critiques: Analyzing Rhetorical Extremism | *Research & Development* | 2024
**Problem:** Understanding ideological transmission and radicalization pathways through computational discourse analysis  
**Solution:** Rigorous NLP analysis of textual and conceptual overlap between academic discourse and extremist frameworks

- **Quantitative methodology:** TF-IDF vectorization, n-gram analysis, network co-occurrence analysis, thematic clustering
- **Key finding:** 16% semantic similarity, 75% conceptual overlap—identified transformation points from abstract critique to concrete threat identification
- **Network analysis:** Built concept co-occurrence networks revealing 3x density difference between abstract vs. operationalized ideologies
- **Strategic insight:** Mapped implicit terminology frameworks showing how shared vocabulary masks fundamentally different conceptual architectures
- **Interactive analysis:** Jupyter notebooks with comprehensive visualization dashboards

**Tech stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NetworkX, matplotlib, TF-IDF, NLP

## WHY PALANTIR ECHO

I bring a unique combination:

1. **Domain expertise with real-world impact:** I've identified and resolved a fundamental paradox in cognitive science that the field has struggled with for decades—demonstrating ability to challenge established models with rigorous evidence.

2. **End-to-end technical execution:** From problem identification → data collection → ML pipeline → LLM integration → publication-ready software, I build complete solutions, not just proofs of concept.

3. **Mission alignment:** Echo requires understanding complex, ambiguous problems and building software that matters. My work addresses foundational questions in human cognition—problems that lack clear answers but demand systematic investigation.

4. **Research rigor meets engineering pragmatism:** I combine academic-quality methodology with production software practices (version control, packaging, CLI design, documentation, reproducibility).

The mental rotation paradox represents exactly the type of problem Echo was designed to solve: complex, multidisciplinary, requiring both theoretical insight and technical implementation. I don't just analyze problems—I build the tools needed to solve them, then use those tools to generate new knowledge.
